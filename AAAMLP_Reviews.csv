Practically good but lagging in concept explanations,Book is really good from practical implementation wise but it would have been better if some background/intuition of the concepts are provided.

Quick programmers ML guide.,"Please do not buy this book to understand ML concepts in depth, book expects you to know basics of Machine learning and deep learning. I would however liked it more if there was segregation among various topics. Chapters are somewhat continues, you feel lost when you resume reading after couple of days.

"Its an Approaching ""mostly ALL"" Machine Learning Problems book!","The fact that this book teaches you how to ""approach"" an ML problem - it stirs up questions in your mind naturally, makes you think, and also helps ease out those questions by giving you a solution to it. You will literally feel, someone is holding your hand and reciting to you, the next line of code for your model and telling you simultaneously, why you should do that!! What else do you need? Condition of the book - it is just what it needs to be :) Very handy. Go for it!!",anushree,2021-05-20,5.0,Verified,0
Not worth it!,"There's a lot of hype for Abhishek Thakur - valid point because he is a 4x GM. But his delivery style is not suited for beginners. Most of what you will find in this book,will be available in other places. (freely available) I would suggest if you are a beginner - spend on something like a Jeremy Howards FastAI course or other ML courses, which will help you learn. This book is also highly priced and not value for money.",Aakash,2021-05-05,1.0,Unverified,0

I have been doing machine learning projects for a while now and I am a self taught person in the field of data science and machine learning. I have gone through various tutorials on various platforms and this book houses almost everything in an organised way whatever I have learnt till now and even more. Very well written and explained on how to implement all your theoretical knowledge into working application. After all, this is the whole objective of the book. However, the author has already mentioned but I would like to reiterate that this is not a book for complete beginners into the field of machine learning and it expects some basic understanding of ML concepts.

Great Book : This book is a practical guide to machine learning,This book is exactly what it claims . It is approach to almost any kind of machine learning problem . The book has a very practical approach towards problem solving and has tones of code . The book is intended to people who knows a bit of background and struggles to start problem solving . The book was and is very helpful for me in day to day life and hence the 5 stars . I want to be clear in the review so that people dont get disappointed after buying the book or refrain from buying the book seeing few negative reviews . The book is immensely helpful for senior professionals like me who are from other branches of software engineering /domain knowledge and still wants to reduce the entry level barrier to get into machine learning and deep learning The book is immensely helpful for students from programming/non-programming background looking to learn and solve AI/ML problems and are scared to venture into it . The book is immensely helpful for people with a lot of theoretical knowledge but less programming knowledge to apply the same into some cool project . The book is not helpful for people who has a masters in mathematics and looking for reference in writing phd thesis in Machine Learning methods .,POORNIMA,2020-09-23,5.0,Verified,One
Must Have book in your library,"Amazingly written in approaching any machine learning problem. I have seen and read lot of books which talks about all the algorithms (from mathematical to intuition point of view), but no one gave me a clear view on how we can approach any dataset and build good models from the data. The flow of chapters are perfect and in the end you will learn a lot on building the ML models. I think it is a must book like how Tibshirani and Trevor's book (Introduction to Statistical Learning) is must for every beginner to pro. Thanks to Abhishek for writing this gem of a book.

As I was reviewing several other books that fall under this spectrum, I decided to give this one a try. Much to my dismay, this book fails to fulfil the objective the author might have had before writing this book.

Cut through the clutter - mostly code no mathematics,"Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem by Abhishek Thakur - An advanced guide to Machine learning concepts with coding examples - This book is for people with at least 1-year experience in machine learning - The book explains all the relevant topics for solving any machine learning problem including feature engineering & selection, metric selection, model parameter optimization, etc - To extract the full benefit, the reader must understand the maths, advantages, and disadvantages of various machine learning algorithms - The book doesn't dive deep into image or text related algorithms but it provides a great foundation for different types of solutions/ algorithms available This book gave me clarity on how to set up my machine learning projects for production. This book, unlike others available in the market, cuts through the clutter and gets right to the core (code). It doesn't go deep into the concept but goes deep into the code and its implementation.

Good books to have hands on practice and learn machine learning,"After reading couple of chapters and have a look at the rest I feel that if someone wants to know how you can solve a machine learning problem with topics like feature selection, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization it's always better to code it and learn and see what's happening, and that's exactly what the author did. You will also get an idea about NLP models like BERT and how you can use docker, flask for deploying your ML model. What I miss in this book is, if it has a couple of chapters to show how to solve a particular problem statement/dataset by combining the topics he covered in the book, and from creating a baseline model to a pretty complex one just to show the end-to-end approach he usually takes to solve a machine learning problem. Just to ideate his thoughts and strategy he usually follows to solve when he gets an ML problem.",Alok Kumar Padhi,2020-07-07,4.0,Verified,5

Touching almost everything that you encounter while building a model. Also adding on touching distributing your model using flask and docker 4. Covers NLP too including transformers which many of starting ML books choose to ignore.

Abhishek has tried to put all his wisdom and experience into this book through his code and examples. On top of everything, he also is hosting a video to solve the doubts related to the book. If you are a fan of fastai and Jeremy Howard and want to learn ML in the top down approach, this book is worth your money.

I debated endlessly with myself whether this is four or five stars, because I would have liked a bit more depth/rationale for approaches (of course, that's a trade-off vs. the book length - and yes, I realized the cover text did tell me, but also things like pro-and-con of some methods might have been expanded), I had hoped even more types of problems/recent ideas would be discussed (don't get me wrong, a wide range of critical topics is covered really well - we are more talking about whether EfficientNet should be discussed in addition to ResNet, or whether more should be said on alternative loss functions like focal-loss, or the latest improvements over U-Net etc.), I wondered whether some topics were glossed over a little/downsides of some things not really discussed, and some minor formalistic complaints (no index, book title on the page headers instead of chapter titles, personally I might have liked the table of contents to show things below the chapter). Perhaps the length of some bits vs. other bits felt a tiny bit uneven (I guess this is just not an academic text-book that got polished over and over - which also makes it an accessible and a very pleasant fun read). But enough on the minor quibbles, here's some things that I really liked: 1. Covering cross-validation really early on before starting with any supervised models: Definitely the right choice, excellent decision! In industry, too many people are sloppy with their model evaluation, emphasizing it this much is something people should be exposed to in more books. In fact, overall there's some pretty good didactic choices in how the material is arranged. 2. I had not been sure about the approach of putting so much code directly into the book, but it works (it helps that the code is very readable/well-explained). 3. Without trying to directly be a book primarily about PyTorch, it's actually a pretty good bare-bones starter pack for PyTorch (even if I prefer the more in-depth book by the fast.ai team). 4. I like the author's writing style. Don't expect formalistic statistics or computer science text book language (and most definitely don't expect theorem - although some papers are referred to, but mostly when the author feels it would be worth your time to read them, there is no attempt to provide a reference for every statement or give a reference to who invented what method when). To get a feel, watch some of the authors YouTube videos - to me the book is a more concise, more polished product with a little bit more explanation of methods/why we use them (as said, maybe a little less than I prefer, but that's taste). 4. Production value: The book is independently published, but with the exception of some of the complaints I mentioned above, I was very happy with design/layout/paper quality etc.",Gander,2021-08-19,4.0,Verified,0
"Excellent, concise book","This is an excellent, practical book on applying machine learning algorithms, and I'd recommend anybody looking to enter the field to pick it up. The author delves not only into algorithms and performance metrics, but also provides recommendations on the practicalities of maintaining a machine learning pipeline. A lot of it is fairly brief, and you'll want to go and explore some of the concepts that the author refers to in further details - but what is covered is very valuable, and the examples are top notch. There are a few awkward sentences that could perhaps do with a little copy editing, but that's my sole criticism, and doesn't detract from this being an easy five stars.",Phil,2021-08-08,5.0,Verified,0

Excellent!,"This is a solid book. It s a bit opinionated, but he does give good reasons. I m still not wholly convinced about separating the feature engineering from modeling. This is why sklearn pipelines were created, so there s no chance of bias especially when you do k-fold cross validation. This book is built upon separation of the folds initially. I also was surprised he didn t use SkLearn Transformers...it s good overall and I really need to go this over again to really be convinced (or not).

Buyers be aware,"This book has major problems. Really. - To start with, the datasets are not available. Good luck to find them, be happy if the author's references to the datasets (when there is a reference) have not changed in between. The repo of the book is just about 4 files, simply with the list of the packages used. Nothing else. No code (he is afraid it would be a copy of his book?). No datasets. - What is the intended audience? The author doesn't explain almost anything. He jumps from one subject to another. It appears that the intended audience is intermediate or advanced readers. But, if so, why starting the book explaining the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? Why other introductory concepts are explained at all? - Poor explanations of the few concepts that the author attempts to explain. His explanation of overfitting and cross-validation is among the worse I have ever seen. - The code has some basic styling errors. Is this what you would expect in a published book from someone that describes himself as ""grand master on Kaggle""? For example, one single assignment of a variable to a list of column names in the cross-validation section is inserted in a loop that runs from 1 to 25 (see attached photo). That is, this single assignment is run 25 times, the same assignment, when it could have been placed before the loop. The author even writes so in the comments. Is this good code styling? To leave dirty code around and publish it so? There are many better, much better books in the market, even for a similar price.",Mark Ross,2020-11-15,1.0,Verified,13

An excellent book for experienced users,"I would describe myself as an experienced machine learning practitioner and found this book the most useful I have read in years. I really liked the opportunity to understand why and how the author had approached the particular issues that occur in almost all real world machine learning / data science projects and his detailed approach to items such as crossfold validation. The book consists of text explaining why the author has approached a particular issue in the way that he did together with copious, easy to read and well annotated code. The two combined provide a fascinating insight into how one individual tackles these kinds of projects. There some gaps, such as how do you measure model drift in a production environment, but despite many years experience, I learnt something in almost every topic that the author covered. I'd say the reader needs 2 or more years machine learning / data science experience, so that the reader is familiar with the issues that the author is tackling and the reason that they are chosen. They should also be happy reading python code so they can get the maximum benefit of the author's approach. This is not an academic textbook and contains no theory, but for someone trying to improve the way they tackle real world problems I'd highly recommend it.",G. S. M. Potter,2020-10-20,5.0,Verified,2

Some of the things that i found really nice: - he motivates and stresses best practices for building and evaluating machine learning models for the most common problems, - he shares different tips & tricks you'll generally spend a lot of time learning while implementing concrete projects / kaggle challenges, - he advocates for a greedy approach towards solving different machine learning problems (always set a clear objective/target and start simple); Abhishek demonstrated that all along the book while discussing different problems. You'll not find in depth explanation of ML algorithms in this book but instead, very good advices on how to properly leverage and apply them in order to solve concrete problems.

Great for machine learning college students!,"I believe that there's a fairly large demographic of people in the community who have probably taken some machine learning course in college. Learning how to program and implement algorithms from scratch is important since this gives us an idea of the inner workings of the theory and mechanics behind the libraries that are implemented in practice. However, I am guessing that it is likely that most of the datasets previously used are quite plain and probably not that difficult or interesting (e.g., the iris dataset). In other words, our experience in academia leaves it quite unprepared regarding how to take the next step. I think that this book does a great job of guiding those who are likely trapped in the academic experience of machine learning, where our work is centered around class assignments or projects that are too cookie-cutter and poorly organized. This book provides some guidance by answering many left-over questions regarding how we can understand a system/methodology that will allow us students to go from homework assignments and towards approaching real-world problems in a professional manner.",Jared Yu,2020-09-22,5.0,Verified,2

A rare coding book that will be useful for years in the future,"I don t normally buy books related to coding for the main reason that they usually become outdated quickly and end up taking up space on my bookshelf, never to be opened again. This book is different though. This is not about learning a specific package or for doing a specific task. This book aims to cover the fundamentals of machine learning regardless of what the task is. The (Python) code examples are easy to follow and use packages with mature APIs (e.g. scikit-learn, pandas, PyTorch) so the code examples will still work for years into the future. It also serves as a great reference for things which are often succinctly explained in a couple of paragraphs (e.g. the explanation of the AUC metric was probably one of the neatest I ve seen). The other great thing about the writing style is that the theory and equations are intentionally kept to the bare minimum (you can find all of this elsewhere) so that you can get to building things as quickly as possible. If you are new to ML you should buy this book if you: > Have completed some MOOCs and are getting started with your own projects or Kaggle > Are wondering how that ML code that you copied on Stack Overflow/GitHub actually works > Prefer to learn quickly by doing rather than sitting through weeks of classes If you have ML experience you should buy this book if you: > Started your ML journey through deep learning (e.g. fast.ai) and you want to firm up your ML fundamentals > Are coaching/mentoring less experienced colleagues and you need some succinct definitions/code examples of concepts like cross-validation or a certain metric > Want to improve your coding style , e.g. write clearer more maintainable code I d definitely recommend this book and it s something I ll probably find myself flicking back through for a while.

The code snippets are excellent as they explain how to make a certain change to a dataset, problem etc and has few tricks as well which I really appreciate. Of course, it s not comprehensive but again the title itself say approaching any problem and the user is supposed to know a thing or two about ml before taking this book. I would recommend this book for all those trying to quickly spin up machine learning problem and build on top of the results.",Parshad,2020-07-09,5.0,Verified,0
A must for all practical ML enthusiasts,"As the author mentions, the book not like standard textbooks - it is much better than the traditional ones. The book is very practical in nature and includes lots of coding which is helpful to get the practical experience while understanding the theory learnt. Some basic programming and ML experience will help the readers better comprehend the textbook components. Step by step tutorial style along with real-world datasets is what I liked the most. A must read for all ML/DS learners.",nabajeet,2020-07-08,5.0,Verified,One
Excellent!! Unlike Traditional Books!!,"Really love the approach Abhishek Thakur took with this book. It s not your traditional Welcome to Machine Learning concept where you re thrown a lot of theory and little code. Instead, it gets you straight into the fire of coding, seeing results, and best practices. My initial concern is will this book only benefit competitive modelers or will it benefit those of us working deep into the industry? So far the code, concepts, and intuitions are applying to both. I m excited to dive deeper.",Zack,2020-07-08,5.0,Verified,0
Reading kaggle notebooks is better,"This book contains shallow (trivial, if you are familiar with ML) contents. I'd recommend reading ""Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems"" and pandas related books to get familiar with the libraries, and then read kaggle notebooks, you'll probably learn more this way.",I read,2020-07-07,1.0,Verified,3
A good starter for applied machine learning,"As the author suggests, this is a good book to start your machine learning journey with some good direction. The neat part is the author is very active in youtube in disseminating his knowledge in this field. This book is just the beginning and if you want to get deeper, just contact the author to make a video on that topic.",Rutayan Patro,2020-07-06,5.0,Verified,One
Frenetic & shallow,"Well, I kind of expected this brochure to be an overview but I didn't expect it to be that shallow and chaotic. The author is jumping from statement to statement, from t-SNE to cross-validation, Sturge's rule and God knows what else all these by page 27. There are no instructions on how to obtain the datasets (I know how and where but that's not the point, we strive for reproducibility here and we are not expected to 'believe' in certain things like in Santa or Yeti). The phrases 'as you can see on this graph' are nothing but funny. Where did that come from? Perhaps, it is well worth 9$ but no more than that. I will stick to the book by Aurelien G. To sum it all up, I will vote for kernels and medium posts but this...it ain't a book :) I can't teach things but I am not trying to. Perhaps we should stick to stuff we are good at?",White Rose,2020-07-05,1.0,Verified,62
Highly recommended for practitioners,"Really enjoying this book for a few reasons. 1) Very useful tips for organizing a ML project, 2) the author promotes good coding habits using repeatable Python scripting instead of Jupyter notebooks, 3) keeps the focus on implementation instead of algorithms.",Danny Morris,2020-07-05,5.0,Verified,9
An excellent book on building predictive models.,"Kaggle has a strange reputation within the data science community. On one hand it's a great source of innovation in a range of sub-fields and when solving a similar problem to an existing Kaggle competition seeing how it was approached by high ranking teams is very valuable. On the other it is a distorted version of what data science actually is in the real world. Usually the (clean) data is provided to you in Kaggle whereas sourcing, collecting and cleaning data is normally a big chunk of a working data scientists life. Finally the approaches in Kaggle competitions are often all about squeezing that tiny improvement out of large numbers of ensembled models. In the real world concessions towards speed, simplicity and interpretability have to be made. The author Abhishek Thakur was the first to achieve GM level across all 4 categories on Kaggle (competitions, kernels, datasets and discussion) . Even a single GM level is an exceptionally difficult task requiring immense amounts of time and skill. My worry going into this book was who it was aimed at and what its purpose is; is it just about doing well on Kaggle or will people who work in industry learn something valuable? Is it aimed at advanced modellers who are looking to become truly elite or would someone with a more general background gain useful knowledge? I am pleased to state that this is a book which is very valuable for the working data scientist and the keen Kaggler. The real value is how it allows us to see how a highly skilled predictive modeller approaches new problems. The book is made up of 13 chapters; ch 1 - Setting up your working environment ch 2 - Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning ch 3 - Cross-validation ch 4 - Evaluation Metrics ch 5 - Arranging Machine Learning Projects ch 6 - Approaching categorical variables ch 7 - Feature engineering ch 8 - Feature selection ch 9 - Hyperparameter optimisation ch 10 - Approaching image classification & segmentation ch 11 - Approaching text classification/regression ch 12 - Approaching ensembling and stacking ch 13 - Approaching reproducible code & model serving While Kaggle is great at discussing a highly placed final entry, the value of this book is a walk through of the steps taken towards a solution; ch 1 on Setting up your working environment, ch 5 Arranging a machine learning project and ch 13 on Reproducible code and model serving I found particularly valuable learning some neat tricks on laying out a project. These are all valuable topics which can get lost when we ask ""How did the solution work"" as in reality the final answer involved lots of iteration lost in just seeing the final product. I really liked the way the author's projects were laid out using a config file and model_dispatcher file allowing for quick modification of which algorithm to use. I had not come across this before but it's a great idea which speeds up the iteration of the modelling process. The other elements that I think makes this book such a great learning solution for people beginning their data science journey is that it shows mistakes which the author then discusses in depth. Finally we see many examples of simpler models beating more complex ones a lesson that is hard to accept when you are starting out and keen to apply XGBoost or Neural Networks to all the things. This book is not just for beginners however - even as someone who has worked as data scientist in industry for a number of years I learnt a great deal from the chapters on dealing with categorical variables, feature engineering and feature selection. As the author notes there are other sources for these solutions but they are spread out across numerous blog posts and forums - having them in a book makes things much easier. I work in customer analytics so when building predictive models a lot of time in spent on feature engineering and feature selection - I learnt a couple of tricks which will be valuable for new projects at work. The book even includes a section on using embeddings on tabular data - a neat approach not widely used in my experience. Finally the book amazingly includes chapters on computer vision problems using PyTorch for classification and image segmentation and nlp using a range of approaches of increasing complexity from bag of words through word2vec to and LSTM and finally a BERT model. The author rightly skips over the complexities of how a CNN or LSTM and Transformer work, but gives enough of a description to get a sense of what is going on. Again the author emphasises the valuable lesson of starting with simpler models and approaches and only then increasing the complexity with constant comparison to a baseline. The author hints (perhaps jokingly) he is considering work on similar books on Computer Vision and NLP - I hope the success of this book encourages him to seriously consider doing this. It is an amazing achievement that the author has created a book which allows the reader to build strong models in a such broad range of domains. The book is well written with the code in particular being excellent. There were one or two spots where the written phrasing was a little hard to follow but these were rare and overall I enjoyed the writing style. The book is eminently practical so the reader will need to find other sources for the theoretical workings of the algorithms used as they gain more experience. Given the breadth the book achieves this is perfectly acceptable. Finally a small technical issue I had with the Kindle version was the lack of a table of contents accessible via the Kindle menu. Not a big thing but does make navigating the book a little trickier than it needs to be. Overall this is an excellent book full of hard won wisdom from a very talented data scientist and educator. I would happily have paid 4 or 5 times its current price and still been very happy with my purchase. I will be highly recommending this book to friends and colleagues who work (or hope to work) in the field.",Stephen Oates,2020-07-05,5.0,Verified,19
"Very useful, learned a lot quickly","This book, written by a legendary Kaggle competitor, is filled with great practical knowledge and code examples (in Python) for approaching machine learning problems. The material is explained simply and clearly. Upon reading through the book I quickly began filling in gaps in my knowledge (fundamental techniques or concepts that I did not know as well as I should). I also learned a lot by looking at the Python code examples, which show many good ways of doing things in Python that I had not known about. Another good aspect of the book is the choice of datasets that are used when illustrating various techniques.",amazonian,2020-07-04,5.0,Verified,3
Excellent book,"Just started reading and glanced through all the pages, this is what I expected from Abhishek. Highly recommend for aspiring data scientist, analyst and machine learning engineers.",Vijayan Nallasami,2020-07-04,5.0,Verified,One
